# Goal: A Python script that downloads multiple SRA files, extracts fastq files, and then assembles the resulting data.
# One of the main issues I’ve had is with my path. Since the prefetch and fastq-dump programs were downloaded through github, 
# I had trouble accessing these files in my path. Therefore, I led the path to my folder. I don’t think this is entirely correct, 
# but it worked. I couldn’t figure out the github-specific path.
# The next step is to assemble the extracted “SRR_1 and SRR_2” files. I am trying to create a loop that takes in 
# only the “SRR_1 and SRR_2” and separately assembles them. 
# “Spades.py --pe-1 ... -o s_epi_spades_test” is what would be used in command line to create an assembly with the two extracted files.


import subprocess

# Samples correspond to sample_1, sample_2, sample_3, sample_4
sra_numbers = [
    "SRR133640", "SRR13155012"]

# Prefetch command downloads SRR files from ncbi website
# I would like to use sys.argv to enter these SRR files from command line rather than create the list, but this worked 
# Download the .sra files to desired folder
for sra_id in sra_numbers:
    print ("Currently downloading: " + sra_id)
    prefetch = "prefetch " + sra_id
    print ("The command used was: " + prefetch)
    subprocess.call(prefetch, shell=True)

# Extract .fastq files from .sra files above
for sra_id in sra_numbers:
    print ("Generating fastq for: " + sra_id)
    fastq_dump = "fastq-dump --split-3 --skip-technical --minReadLen 64 --defline-seq @\$ac.\$si --defline-qual \"+\" /Users/matthewwielgat/desktop/micro657/final_pro/" + sra_id
    print ("The command used was: " + fastq_dump)
    subprocess.call(fastq_dump, shell=True)
    print ("test")

# Fastq files corresponding to samples

    "SRR133640_1.fastq + SRR133640_2.fastq", "SRR13155012_1.fastq + SRR13155012_2.fastq"]

# Create 4 assemblies with each combination above
# Code to assemble in command line
